My son is turning 1 this June and he loves playing Minecraft on Xbox 360 and watching popularmmos on youtube. I've got Minecraft installed on my PC and like to get it set up so he can fool around with lucky blocks and other insanity, since that's what he seems to enjoy. I've also gotten whitelisted at sandlotminecraft.com so that he can do some things on the server.

So, I'm looking for help, finding fun mods and installing them, and any other ideas an 1 year old might enjoy with minecraft.
